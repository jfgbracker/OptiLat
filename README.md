# Optical lattice builder 

This package provides the tools to compute the time-independant EM field created by the interferences of multiple laser beams.

## Installation

First download the repository and extract it where you want. Then, run in your python environment 

```bash
pip install path/to/package/OptiLat
```

or 

```bash
pip install -e path/to/package/OptiLat
```

if you want to be able to modify it in place.

**N.B** : This package requires the `bloch_schrodinger` package to make use of it's most powerful methods.
It is only imported when needed, so `Beam`, `OptiLat.compute_fields` and the formatting helpers work
without it; only the interactive `OptiLat.plot` method requires it.

## Getting started

Once you have installed the package, open in a jupyter viewer the [Getting Started](docs/GettingStarted.ipynb) notebook.
